[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BigWigsMods/oRA3/compare/v8.0.6...v8.0.7)

- Stop creating "file missing" errors for git users, which are now expected to be using separate libraries.  
- Cooldowns: Add another Warlock Spell Lock   
    The sacrificed version was missing, should probably look into the other spells as well.
